Core: Leverage for callers. Locality for maintainers. Testability for everyone.

Module: Scale-agnostic unit with an Interface and Implementation. Prohibited: Unit, component, service.

Interface: Complete surface a caller must know (type signatures, invariants, ordering constraints, error modes, configuration, performance traits). Prohibited: API, signature.

Implementation: Internal body of code within a Module. Use over "Adapter" unless the Seam itself is the topic.

Depth: Ratio of behavior to Interface complexity (high behavior behind a small Interface).

Seam: Physical location where an Interface lives; allows altering behavior without editing the call site. Prohibited: Boundary.

Adapter: Concrete artifact satisfying an Interface at a Seam. Describes role/slot filled, not internal substance.

Leverage: Caller-side benefit of Depth (more capability per unit of learned Interface).

Locality: Maintainer-side benefit of Depth (concentration of change, bugs, and knowledge in one place).
