All machine-readable tokens MUST be in square brackets `[...]`.

[Auth: Scope]: [Read, Write, Admin, None]

[Risk: Level]: [Low, Medium, High, Critical]

[Policy]: [Enforced, Advisory, Audit-Only]. Written `[Policy: Enforced]` etc. when tagging a concrete rule.

[Data: Classification]: [Public, Internal, Confidential, PII, Special-Category]. Special-Category = GDPR Art. 9 (health, biometrics, race, religion, sexual orientation, etc.) — strictest handling obligations.

[Confidence: Level]: [Confirmed, Probable, Possible]. Confirmed = directly observed; Probable = strong indicator missing one link; Possible = heuristic needing verification — phrase as "requires verification", never assert.

[Remediation: Effort]: [Low, Medium, High]

[Competency: Level]: [Not-Ready, Paired, Guided, Solo]. Ordered weakest-to-strongest. Solo = wrote comparable work unaided; Guided = succeeds with full spec/acceptance criteria; Paired = succeeds only with scaffold + step-by-step prompts; Not-Ready = cannot do or explain. Self-report is provisional `[Confidence: Possible]` until corroborated by observed work. Owned by competency-profile.

[Inferred: Unverified]: [true]. Marks output from an ephemeral in-context baseline. Never applied to blueprint-drift findings.

[Priority: MoSCoW]: [Must, Should, Could, Wont]. Written `[Priority: Must]` etc. Must = release fails without it; Should = viable workaround; Could = desirable if capacity; Wont = explicitly out-of-scope (records decision). Owned by gather-requirements PRD stream.

[Doc: Archetype]: [QuickStart, Technical, Troubleshooting, Installation, Commentary]. Path bindings owned by document-a-codebase.

[Scope: Artefact]: [Release, Security-Governance, Health, Digest]. Digest = client-facing weekly progress email from client-email-digest. Extend this enumeration here when adding report-producing skills.

Output Portability: All client-facing artefacts (FDS, blueprint, audits, docs) as export-clean Markdown — standard heading hierarchy, no renderer-fragile constructs, tables degrade gracefully. PDF/branding mechanism is separate.
